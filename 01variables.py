# 위처럼 두번 variable을 지정하면 아래거로 최종 저장된다.

# naming conventions
# names can contain letters, digits, and the underscore character;
# if it starts with an underscore it has a special meaning

# a variable name can't start with a number, it can only start with
# underscore or letters;

# special characters(:,"$) are not allowed in variable names

# variable names can't be reserved words like: True, False, None, class, if, else, while etc

#  it's recommended to use words written with lower case letters, seperated by
#  underscores for example max_value = 999. This is known as snake_case

#  avoid using words that have special meaning in python like list, set, str...

#  python is case-sensitive (it makes a distinction between lower
#  and upper-case letters), and so are variable names.
